# Specialized AI Summarizer for Customer Support Tickets

This project guides you through creating a **specialized AI application** that summarizes customer support tickets to help reduce manual workload and improve response time. Using frameworks like Hugging Face in Google Colab, you’ll build a simple, domain-optimized summarizer from end to end.

---

## Project Overview

Support teams deal with countless, repetitive complaint logs every day. This tutorial demonstrates how specialized language models can transform lengthy text into concise, actionable summaries, making it easier to prioritize and respond. By narrowing the model’s scope, you achieve greater accuracy and practicality than generic, broad-based AI systems.

---

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you will need:  

- A Google Colab account  
- A Hugging Face account with an access token  
- A sample complaint log in plain text (for example, `complaint_log.txt` available on ProjectPro resources)

---

## 5-Step Tutorial

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Set up your notebook with the required Python packages and authenticate to Hugging Face so you can load the summarization models.

---

### Step 2: Upload the Input File

Upload a plain-text support ticket log file to Colab, which will serve as the summarizer’s input.

---

### Step 3: Load and Summarize the Text

Use a pre-trained summarization pipeline from Hugging Face Transformers. You will read the complaint log, pass it to the summarizer, and generate a concise summary with clear length controls to keep results consistent and relevant.

---

### Step 4: Generate a Structured Summary Report

Format your results in Markdown so the report includes both the generated summary and the full original text. This makes it easier for teams to store, share, and audit complaint summaries.

---

### Step 5: Download the Summary File

Once the summarizer generates the report, download it directly from Google Colab as a Markdown file. This allows seamless integration into existing workflows or knowledge bases.

---

## Sample Output

A typical summary report will include:  

- A one-to-two sentence summary of the ticket  
- The complete ticket text for context  
- Markdown formatting for easy storage or sharing

---

## Next Steps

You can extend this project by:  

- Testing other summarization models like `facebook/bart-large-cnn`  
- Integrating retrieval-augmented data from past tickets  
- Building a classification pipeline to categorize ticket topics
