Issue:  
I purchased a SmartHome Thermostat Model X200 last month from your website. It worked fine for the first week, but then it started losing Wi-Fi connectivity every few hours. I’ve tried resetting it multiple times and even changed my router settings as per the FAQ, but the issue persists.

I reached out to your support team last week and was promised a follow-up within 48 hours — I haven't heard back yet. This is very frustrating, especially since I rely on the device to regulate temperature while I’m away from home. I would appreciate either a full refund or a replacement unit that works reliably.

Please escalate this issue to a senior technician and get back to me as soon as possible.
